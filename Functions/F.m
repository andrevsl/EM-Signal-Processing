%Function F(theta,phi)
%
% Recommended equation for the pattern of a rectangular flat array where:
% 
% f1 is the pattern of a single element in the array 1 for isotropic
% N is the number of array elements in the X-Axis
% M is the number of array elements in the Y-Axis
% freq is the operation frequency use to calculate lamda
% lamda is the operation wavelength
% beta is a function of lamda
% d1 is the distance between the array elements in the X-axis
% d2 is the distance between the array elements in the Y-axis
% squiggleC1 is drive currents phase displacement between adjacent elements in the X-axis
% squiggleC2 is drive currents phase displacement between adjacent elements in the y-axis
